# AdaLens - AI-Powered Image Descriptions (Chrome Extension)

This repository contains the frontend code for the **AdaLens Chrome Extension**, a tool that automatically makes websites more accessible. It scans web pages for images missing descriptive alt text, uses the Google Gemini AI to generate a meaningful description, and applies it to the image, making the web more accessible for users who rely on screen readers.

This extension is the user-facing part of the project and communicates with a separate, secure [backend server](https://github.com/sijun-kevin-hu/AdaLens_Backend) to process images.
